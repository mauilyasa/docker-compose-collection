## Docker Compose Collection

This repo contains a collection of Docker Compose YAML and its configurations for various services. The Docker Compose is set up for testing and production-ready use that uses traefik as its reverse proxy.

I put the documentation about how to run these services in my docs site: https://docs.ilyasa.my.id/books/docker-compose-collection. You can find detailed instructions on setup and configuration. 

Feel free to use this Docker Compose collection.
